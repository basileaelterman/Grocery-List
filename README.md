# Grocery List

This is one of my many projects I created in order to learn to work with Symfony. This one turned out to be the best one I've made (best quality of code). The frontend is cheap, and I'm not planning on changing it that much because I want to focus on more advanced projects in order to become better at actually writing code, if that makes any sense.
Not much to add to this.

There's a live demo on my portfolio website if you're curious to see this project in action. You can check it out [here](https://crud.basileaelterman.com).
I also suggest you to reach out to me in any way if you've found bugs, security issues or notice bad practices within my code. I'm not perfect (yet) :-)

That's basically everything I can say about this project. 
Thanks for taking your time to read this!
